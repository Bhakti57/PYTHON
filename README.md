# PYTHON 

## What is python?
Python is interpreted, object-oriented, high level and dynamic typing language.

## Why to learn python? 
Python syntax are easy than other language.

The print function in python is a function that outputs to your console window whatever you say you want to print out.
variable: variable only starts with alphabet and underscore. it may contains numeric but it cannot be used special characher.
string concatenation/ join two strings variable: we can join string if both are string. and we can join variable when both are variables.

## keywords: 
keywords are reserved words in python.it cannot be used as function name,variable name or any other identifier.

## statements: 
instruction that you write in code and that a python interpreter can execute are called statement.

## comments : 
comments are nothing but the sentence that the python interpreter ignore.
indentation:Indentation in Python refers to the (spaces and tabs) that are used at the beginning of a statement or a code we write. by using indentation our code starts looking well organised and more readable.

# DATATYPE: 
### 1.integer: 
integer value means number without decimal.
### 2.float: 
float value means number with decimal point.
### 3.complex: 
complex is number which contain real and imaginary component represented as a+bj.
### 4.string: 
sequence of character.
### 5.list: 
List is an ordered collection (also known as a sequence ) of elements.
### 6.tuple: 
Tuples are ordered collections of elements that are unchangeable.
### 7.set: 
set is an unordered collection of data items that are unique.
### 8.dictionary:
dictionaries are unordered collections of unique values stored in (Key-Value) pairs. 
### 9.boolean: 
to represent boolean values (True and False) we use the bool data type.
### 10.range: 
range() used to generate a sequence of numbers from a start number.

## Dynamic Typing:
In python, variables are the reserved memory locations to store values. Python is a dynamically typed language which is not required to mention the type of variable while declaring. It performs the type checking at run time.

## Static Typing: 
In statically typed programming languages which is required to mention the type of variable while declaring. It performs the type checking at compile time.

# Operator:


## Arithmatic Operator:
### 1.Addition(+):  
### 2. Subtraction(-):
### 3.multiplication():
### 4. Division(/)
### 5. Floor division(//): 
floor division gives answer without decimal point.
### 6. Modulus(%):
Modulus(The remainder of the division)
### 7. Exponent(**):
power of number.


## Relational operator:
### 1.Greater than: 
### 2. Less than
### 3. Equal to
### 4. Not equal to 
### 5. Greater than equal to (>=)
### 6. less than equal to (<=)


## Identity operator :
### 1. is operator
### 2. is not operator 


## Assignment operator:
### 1. Assign (=)
### 2. Add and assign(+=)
### 3. Subtract and assign(-=)
### 4. Multiply and assign()
### 5. Divide and assign(/=)
### 6. Floor divide and assign(//=)
### 7. Modulus and assign(%=)
### 8. Exponent and assign(**=)


## Logical opertor :
### 1. and operator: 
true if both true, Logical and always returns the second value
### 2. or operator: 
true if one is true, Logical and always returns the second value
### 3. not operator:
True if the expression is false.  Logical not always return False for nonzero value.


## Membership Operator: 
### 1. in operator:
### 2. not in operator


## Bitwise operator
### 1. & Bitwise and
### 2. OR
### 3. XOR 

## String
### String is a sequence of character. Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks. In Python, string is an immutable sequence data type.

### Multi-line strings must be embed in triple quotes.
### String Functions lower()
#### upper()
#### title()
#### capitalize()

## Numeric Type:
### The numeric data in Python is generally in three formats namely Integer, Float, and Complex.
### We can create an integer variable using the two ways:
#### 1. Directly assigning an integer value to a variable
#### 2. Using a int() class.
